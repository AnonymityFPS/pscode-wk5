// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
WRITE "Enter two numbers to add"
READ num1
READ num2
sum = num1+num2
WRITE Sum
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
WRITE "Enter number to see if its even or odd"
READ num1
IF (num1 % 2 == 0) 
PRINT "Number is Even"
ELSE
PRINT "Number is Odd"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

BEGIN
WRITE "Enter five numbers"
READ num1
READ num2
READ num3
READ num4
READ num5
// Find average of the numbers.
Sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5\
average = sum / 5
PRINT average
//Find Largest number
temp_max = -999999
FOR i = 1 to 5
IF num_i > temp_max
THEN temp_max = num_i
PRINT "Largest number: temp_max
// Find Smallest number
temp_min = 999999
FOR i = 1 to 5
IF num_i < temp_min
THEN temp = num_i
PRINT "Smallest number: temp_min
END
